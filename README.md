# Employee-Attrition-R

I am interested in practicing data analysis and machine learning in R for real world applications. To get some practice and to sharpen my skills, I have decided to analyze a dataset from Kaggle.com related to employee attrition. My goal is to clean the data, explore the data, and model the data to get a better understanding of why employee would leave the company. This kind of analysis could help companies better retain employees in the future and save money.
